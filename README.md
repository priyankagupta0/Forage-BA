# Forage-BA

This project is a part of the Data Science virtual internship program offered by Forage with British Airways.

## The virtual Internship is divided into two main tasks
1. Web scraping to gain company insights
2. Predicting customer buying behaviour

## Task 1: Extracting Company Insights through Web Scraping

When customers choose to book a flight with British Airways (BA), they engage with various touchpoints associated with the BA brand. Recognizing and comprehending customer sentiments, requirements, and feedback is imperative for any business, including British Airways.

The primary objective of this initial task revolves around the extraction and compilation of customer feedback data from a third-party source. Subsequently, this data will undergo analysis to reveal any valuable insights that may be discovered.

The customer review data pertaining to British Airways was obtained from Skytrax.

The outcomes of this endeavor have been consolidated into a concise slide presentation, summarizing the insights obtained.

## Task 2: Forecasting Customer Purchasing Patterns

Modern customers possess unprecedented access to a vast reservoir of information, which has fundamentally transformed the traditional buying process. Consequently, hoping that a customer will make a last-minute purchase of flights or holidays at the airport is no longer a viable strategy. In this context, a reactive approach is suboptimal. Airlines must proactively engage with customers to secure their bookings well before they embark on their vacations.

This task centers around the development of a robust predictive model aimed at forecasting successful bookings based on analysis of customer booking data.
